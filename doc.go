// Package gemini provides an easy interface to create client and servers that
// speak the Gemini protocol.
//
// At the moment, this library focuses more on the client side of things, and
// support is not guaranteed. It is mostly a personal library.
//
// None of the client functions ever modify your URL before sending it to the
// server.
